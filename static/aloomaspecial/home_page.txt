                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">1. Can a porta potty be placed on a slight incline or slope?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">For safety and proper functionality, all portable restrooms in USA must be placed on a firm and level surface. A slope can make the unit unstable and can cause the deodorizing liquid in the tank to sit unevenly, reducing its effectiveness. Our delivery experts are trained to find the best possible level location at your site.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">2. What if my event traffic is heavier than expected and the unit needs service?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We pride ourselves on helping you estimate the right number of units. However, if you find that usage is exceptionally high, we offer on-demand, mid-event service calls for an additional fee. Please contact us as soon as you anticipate a need so we can schedule a technician for you.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">3. Do the standard portable restrooms come with interior lighting for nighttime events?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Our standard units do not have built-in lighting. They have translucent roofs to let in ambient and natural light. For events that extend into the evening, we recommend placing the units in a well-lit area or adding simple, battery-operated LED puck lights inside, which are an effective and inexpensive solution.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">4. What is your typical service radius for delivery?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We serve a wide geographic area. Our standard porta potty rental prices in USA include delivery within a specific radius of our hub. For locations outside of that zone, including remote rural sites, we are still often able to provide service but may need to add a small surcharge to cover the additional travel time and fuel costs.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">5. Are all necessary supplies, like toilet paper, included in the rental?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes, absolutely. Every single one of our portable restroom rentals is delivered fully stocked with ample toilet paper and a hand sanitizer dispenser. Our deluxe and luxury models that feature sinks are also stocked with soap and paper towels.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">6. How far in advance should I book my porta potty rental?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">For standard units, we can often accommodate requests with a few days' notice. However, for weekends, holidays, and especially for our luxury restroom trailers, we strongly recommend booking at least two to four weeks in advance to ensure availability.</p>
